This is a public madeforall project Madeforall is a local nonprofit dedicated to distributing keyboard kits to those who lack the necessary tools for digital literacy. We collect tech donations from community members both in local and global communities. These donations are then refurbished, cleaned and given to our nonprofit partners in our local communities to distribute these donations to the people who need it the most.

This project is free and public to use to anyone interested, it was created to provide keyboard enthusiasts more options on custom keyboards. We have created this in hopes of bring more people into the hobby. Learn more about us at madeforall.org, donate to us here: https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/madeforall

About Lube Machine Mech: This is a second go at a semi auto lube machine. The bottom housing of a switch is placed on the switch holder. Stepper motors are then used to move a syringe that dispenses lube onto bottom housing. Code is nessisary for this project, email us about getting that and more details. This was by far the project that took the most time, it was abandoned becuase there was little end in sight. Many optimization changes need to be made to make this worthwhile. I do believe this design is viable and has potential though.
